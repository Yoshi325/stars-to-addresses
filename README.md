But... how to run the script?
-----------------------------

There are several ways to do this, I'm not suggesting the only way, the correct
way, and maybe not even the simplest way. Any doubts you have on this, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/marado/stars-to-addresses/issues).

1) Clone this repository. You can find out how to do it on [github's
   documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/);

2) Open the cloned directory, and place the GoogleBookmarks.html files there;

3) Execute the `stars-to-addresses.py` script (if you're using a console, 
   just type `python stars-to-addresses.py`.
